* Welcome back and thank you for watching this video.

* I am Traap

* I will be demonstrating using ArchLinux from Windows Subsystem for Linux 2

* The following tools are used

  + Remmina for RDP a connection
  + Windows Terminal
  + Neovim
  + Wiki.vim
  + LaTeX

* Note:
   1. This configuration requires me to use ctrl-[ for escape key.
   2. So, you might notice rather odd keystrokes at the top of your window.
   3. You will see screen tearing occur when Neovim completion pop-ups are
      displayed.
